Customer Shopping Behavior Analysis
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of customer shopping habits using an end-to-end data pipeline. It involves Data Cleaning with Python, Database Management & Querying with SQL Server, and Data Visualization with Power BI to uncover actionable business insights.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Python (Pandas): Used for data cleaning, handling missing values, and feature engineering (e.g., creating age groups).

SQL (MS SQL Server): Used to perform complex data analysis and answer specific business questions regarding revenue, customer loyalty, and shipping impacts.

Power BI: Used to design an interactive dashboard to visualize KPIs and trends.

📈 Key Business Questions Addressed
Using SQL, I extracted insights to answer:

Revenue Analysis: Comparing total revenue generated by Male vs. Female customers.

Customer Segmentation: Categorizing customers as 'New', 'Returning', or 'Loyal' based on purchase history.

Shipping & Subscription: Analyzing if express shipping or subscription status leads to higher average spending.

Product Performance: Identifying the top 3 most purchased products within each category.
